# Bank Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning 

##Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn for a bank using machine learning techniques. By identifying at-risk customers, the bank can improve retention strategies and enhance customer satisfaction.

##Problem statement

The bank wants to create more value out of its customer data. Analyze the data and propose how internal and external utilization of the analysis results increases the banks revenues.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Utilized SMOTE for balancing highly imbalanced datasets.
- Built and compared multiple machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- Dashboard visualization with Power BI.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas, NumPy for data processing
  - Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn for machine learning and visualization
- **Tools**:
  - Power BI for dashboards
  - Google Colab for development

## Results
- **Accuracy**: 89%
- **AUC-ROC Score**: 95%
- Significantly improved the bankâ€™s ability to identify at-risk customers.
