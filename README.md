# Bank Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning 

**Overview** 

This project aims to predict customer churn for a bank using machine learning techniques. By identifying at-risk customers, the bank can improve retention strategies and enhance customer satisfaction.

**Problem statement**

The bank wants to create more value out of its customer data. Analyze the data and propose how internal and external utilization of the analysis results increases the banks revenues.

**Features**

Preprocessing and balancing data with SMOTE.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for feature insights.

Machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM,  KNN(KNeighborsClassifier),Gradient Boosting Classifier 
Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Model evaluation using accuracy and AUC-ROC metrics.
